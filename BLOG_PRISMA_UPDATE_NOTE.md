# Blog Schema Update Note

The Prisma schema has been updated to make all fields in the `Blog` model optional.

## Required Actions

After pulling these changes, you need to regenerate the Prisma client to apply these schema changes:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client with the updated schema
npx prisma generate

# Push schema changes to the database
npx prisma db push
```

## Changes Made

1. Updated the `Blog` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`:
   - Made all fields optional by adding `?` to their types:
     - `title`
     - `subtitle` (was already optional)
     - `authorName`
     - `authorDesignation`
     - `publishedDate`
     - `docFile`
     - `coverImage`
     - `content`

2. Updated the application code to handle these optional fields:
   - Modified the DTO to make all fields optional
   - Updated the controller to remove required fields from API schema
   - Updated the service to handle missing fields with appropriate defaults

## Default Values

When fields are not provided, the system will use these defaults:
- `publishedDate`: Current date
- `active`: true
- File naming: Uses timestamp if title is not provided
- Empty arrays for `sectorIds` if not provided

## Impact

These changes allow creating blog entries with minimal required information. The API will continue to work with existing blog entries that have these fields.
