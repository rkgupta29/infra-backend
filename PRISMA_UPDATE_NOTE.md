# Prisma Schema Update Note

The Prisma schema has been updated to make the `title` and `date` fields optional in the `ResearchPaper` model.

## Required Actions

After pulling these changes, you need to regenerate the Prisma client to apply these schema changes:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client with the updated schema
npx prisma generate

# Push schema changes to the database
npx prisma db push
```

## Changes Made

1. Updated the `ResearchPaper` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`:
   - Made `title` field optional by adding `?` to its type
   - Made `date` field optional by adding `?` to its type

2. Updated the application code to handle these optional fields:
   - Modified the controller to accept requests without title and date
   - Updated the service to handle missing title and date fields
   - Set default values when these fields are not provided

## Impact

These changes allow creating research papers without specifying a title or date. When not provided:
- Title will default to an empty string
- Date will default to the current date

The API will continue to work with existing research papers that have these fields.
